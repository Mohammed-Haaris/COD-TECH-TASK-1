**Domain:** Front-End Development  
**Duration:** Sept to Oct 2024

## Project Overview

This To-Do List project is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It helps users organize their daily activities by adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. The project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** To add dynamic functionality, such as adding/removing tasks and marking them as done.

## Features

- **Add New Task:** Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Remove Task:** Users can delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as completed, and they will be visually distinguished.
- **Save Tasks:** *(Upcoming feature)* Users will be able to save their tasks to local storage so that their list remains even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

Some potential future updates I have planned for this project include:

- **User Authentication:** Add user login and registration to save personalized task lists.
- **Due Dates:** Allow users to set due dates for tasks and sort tasks based on their deadlines.
- **Task Categories:** Enable categorization of tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).
- **Priority Levels:** Introduce task priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
